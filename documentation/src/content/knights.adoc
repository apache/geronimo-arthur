= Arthur Knights

Knight is the name given to Arthur extensions.
The extensions are generally responsible to generate a valid configuration to let a library become native.

== Available knights

- link:jsch-knight.html[JSch]: it contains some end user API integrated with built-in extensions to simplify application graal-ification,
- link:openwebbeans-knight.html[OpenWebBeans]: Apache OpenWebBeans (CDI SE runtime) support.
- link:slf4j-knight.html[SLF4J]: SLF4J (JUL binding) integration.
- link:hsqldb-knight[HSQLDB]: HSQL database integration.
- link:openjpa-knight[OpenJPA]: Apache OpenJPA integration.
// - derby-knight: Apache Derby integration.

== Configure a Knight in Arthur Maven plugin

A knight can typically be configured in `graalExtensions`, it can used the long notation but also a shortcut notation since all Knights respect the same convention.

Typically the following knight:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.geronimo.arthur.knights</groupId>
  <artifactId>jsch-knight</artifactId>
  <version>${arthur.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Can just be referenced as `jsch` in the Arthur Maven plugin:

[source,xml]
----
<graalExtensions>
  <graalExtension>jsch</graalExtension>
</graalExtensions>
----

TIP: if you need a control over knight dependencies - to exclude/replace some dependencies - you can also just define it as a standard dependency.
